This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About
This project is a collection of visualizations and simulations that I
have created to approximate the values of pi, as a fun side project.
The p5.js library (which is amazing - highly recommend!) was unobtrusive
and allowed for a lot of creative freedom! If you want to learn more about the p5.js library,
I highly recommend checking out videos by Daniel Shiffman at *The Coding Train* youtube channel,
as well as reading his book, *The Nature of Code* to learn more about the library and its use for
physics and nature simulations and visualizations.

as well as other miscellaneous tools I used:

## Deployed on Vercel

Next.js app deployed using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
